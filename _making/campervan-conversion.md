Perhaps the biggest maker project I've ever undertaken: converting an empty delivery van into a campervan to travel around Europe.

My partner, Amy, and I, decided we wanted to spend some time travelling. We wanted to do it independently, with our dog, and have as much freedom as possible. So a campervan conversion seemed like a good way to go, and the opportunity to do it ourselves seemed too good to resist. So that's what we did. It took about 18 months of evening and weekend work, and we documented as much as we could on a blog: <https://wildebeestdiaries.wordpress.com>. Go there for all the gory details.
