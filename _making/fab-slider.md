Learning about motion control
<!--more-->

Fab Slider is one of a number of projects I'm working on that fall under the umbrella of '[tools for learning](../projects/tools-for-learning)'. The artefact itself is a camera slider, designed to enable smooth panning shots in video or time-lapses, and especially useful in making project demo videos. 

But my real reasons for making it are as an excuse to learn about motion control and machine building (in particular, *high quality* motion control and machine building), and to explore some ideas about how we can learn through making. 

As a result it's very heavily documented over on the [project site](https://andrewsleigh.com/fab-slider/) (GitHub repo)
