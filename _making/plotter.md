From bits to atoms, screen to paper 
<!--more-->

This plotter is an part of an ongoing investigation into machine design that started with my camera slider. The slider is a one axis machine, the plotter has two. Both are simple machines, but in order to work, need to be _good_. So building this plotter has been an exercise in getting the last 10% right. It also serves as an output for my experiments with Processing and p5. 

It runs a variant of the standard Grbl software (adapted for pen plotters that use a servo motor to raise and lower the pen). Design is in Fusion360. All the 3D files and documentation are available in the GitHub repo.
