Procedural snowflakes generated in p5
<!--more-->

I got my plotter working in time for Christmas, so I wanted to use it to make some cards for friends and family. I also thought it would be nice to build a GUI so other people could generate their own festive vectors â€“ for their own plotter.

And it gave me an excuse to try an port my Processing skills to p5, the javascript implementation, so I can do more web-based generative art in the future.
