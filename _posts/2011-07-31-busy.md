There&#8217;s nothing worse than reading one someone&#8217;s apologies on their blog about how they&#8217;ve been too busy to update it. So I offer no apologies for the lack of updates here over the past few weeks.<!--more-->

Instead I offer you a few tidbits about what I&#8217;ve been up to. I&#8217;ve finally finished my mammoth write-up of my latest MYOG project, another backpack. Make yourself a cup of tea, and [read this](/making/lightweight-backpack).

I&#8217;ve also been busy over the past few months helping to organise [Brighton Mini Maker Faire](http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/). Check the website, or watch this wonderful video kindly shot for us by Philip of [Larchmont Films](http://larchmontfilms.com/) (hire them today!) for a taster:



You should of course come down to the Dome on Saturday 3rd September and experience it for yourself.

And over the last month, I&#8217;ve been back working with [100%Open](http://www.100open.com) on the second version of E.ON&#8217;s co-creation community, [E.ON Innovation](https://www.eoninnovation.com), which we launched this weekend. Very exciting, and a great industry-leading initiative from E.ON.
