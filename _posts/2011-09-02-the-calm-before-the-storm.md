It&#8217;s Friday morning, 24 hours before [Brighton Mini Maker Faire](http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/). Tomorrow is the day that has been the focal point of my life for the past 6 months. This is how it started for me.<!--more-->

One bright Saturday In February, Liah and I went down to the Skiff to take part in a [Zombie Badge Workshop](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewsleigh/sets/72157626092949670/), essentially a soldering class for complete beginners. 

We spent a couple of hours there, being taught how to solder and make simple circuits by the [Build Brighton](http://www.buildbrighton.com) folk, and really enjoyed the whole experience. Learning a new skill, the atmosphere; being with a group of people who all walked through the door unable to do something, and 2 hours later realised they could.

Over the past year, I had been doing more and more projects at home, learning to sew, making camping gear, and so on. So it was inspiring to be working on a project with other people for a change. Afterwards, I collared Mike and found out about Build Brighton, their workshops and the hackspace movement. It was all very intriguing. 

He also mentioned that they had been talking about putting on a bigger event — a workshop-on-steroids — in Brighton. Something called a Maker Faire. There was a group of people already involved, they&#8217;d had some meetings, done a lot of [groundwork](http://lanyrd.com/2011/igniteldn4/sdkbr/), but had reached the point where they needed someone to co-ordinate people and energy. At this point I had been freelancing for 4 or 5 months and was looking out for something new to sink my teeth into. Although this was clearly not a project that would help pay the rent, it sounded too interesting to pass up. So I went home, um&#8217;d and ah&#8217;d over whether I could afford to take on such a big commitment, and after a couple of days signed up. 

A few weeks later, we all sat down in the Earth and Stars pub, and I met for the first time some of the other people who had been getting the show on the road before I&#8217;d got involved. [Mike Pountney](https://twitter.com/#!/mikepea) (who ended up being my main partner-in-crime, co-organiser and general getter-of-things-done), Honor Harger from Lighthouse, Anna Dumitriu (who&#8217;s running the event on the day), Andy Budd from Clearleft, Nilden Ozkan and others. They had made considerable progress, securing some initial financial support, getting the go-ahead from O&#8217;Reilly (who own the Maker Faire brand, and sorted out banners and Make goodies for us), tapping up venues to see who could donate a suitable space, and also working on a wider programme of events that became known as [Brighton Digital Festival](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/), of which we&#8217;re just a part.

Over the next 6 months, I met a whole crew of people who had been instrumental in setting Brighton Mini Maker Faire up and devoted time to making it happen: Ant Miller, Graham Cameron from O&#8217;Reilly, Toby Cole, Barney Livingstone, Natalia Buckley and others from Build Brighton. Sarah Angliss (aka Spacedog) who is organising the after-party. Rowan Stanfield and her colleagues from [Content & Motion](http://www.contentandmotion.co.uk/), who have done such a monumental job getting the word out, setting up interviews and running our online presence. Phillip Berman from [Larchmont Films](http://www.larchmontfilms.com/) who has shot our Meet the Maker videos. Maxine, Marilena and Josh from the Brighton Dome.

I managed to rope in a few other people to help out. Amy to make bunting, banners and signage; Angus Hubbard from [Loaded Productions](http://www.loadedproductions.co.uk/) to shoot a film on the day. There&#8217;s a whole crew of volunteers who&#8217;ll be working tonight and on the day to set everything up and help things run smoothly who I haven&#8217;t even met yet. I hope it&#8217;s clear that this has been a hugely collaborative and shared effort.

And of course, an army of Makers is about to descend on the Dome. I hope that I will have time on the day to meet them all, learn about their projects — and maybe do some soldering.
