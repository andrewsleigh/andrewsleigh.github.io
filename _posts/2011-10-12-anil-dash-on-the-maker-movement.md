Interesting video interview [here](http://dashes.com/anil/2011/09/recognizing-the-maker-movement.html) between blogger and entrepreneur, Anil Dash and Dale Dougherty, founder of Maker Media, Make Magazine, etc. They talk about the bigger picture: politics and apathy, families, risk, authority and learning, and more.
