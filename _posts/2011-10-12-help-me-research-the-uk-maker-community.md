    <strong>24 Oct Update:</strong> Thank you to everyone who has contributed so far. I&#8217;ve had a great response, and had the privilege to talk to a whole bunch of inspiring, creative people. I&#8217;m not recruiting for any more phone interviews now, but if you&#8217;d like to share your thoughts, I&#8217;ll leave the online survey open for another couple of weeks.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>5 Nov Update:</strong> Survey is closed now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;ll be in touch with everyone who&#8217;s taken part in mid-November.

O&#8217;Reilly are the publishers of Make magazine and the Makezine.com website; they&#8217;re the people behind Maker Faire and Maker Shed; and they publish great books on Arduino, circuit-bending, amateur robotics, creative hacking and related topics.

They want to understand how they can better support the UK maker community, and I&#8217;m helping them find out. 

If you&#8217;re reading this, the chances are you&#8217;re a maker of some sort, or you&#8217;re involved in innovation or manufacturing, technology or the creative industries. You might be a supplier of maker products or services, or involved in education or training in maker skills. Either way, I&#8217;d really like to get your views and ideas. 

## How you can help</p>

<del datetime="2011-10-24T14:45:33+00:00">I&#8217;m going to be doing some phone interviews through October, and if you&#8217;re interested in chatting to me about makers in the UK, I&#8217;d love to speak to you. You can reach me on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/andrewsleigh">twitter</a> or email (hello at andrewsleigh dot com) to find out more, or arrange a time to speak. Or you can leave your details in the <a href="#">survey form</a> below and I&#8217;ll get in touch.</del>

### <del datetime="2011-11-05T11:34:23+00:00">2. Answer 7 survey questions</del>

<del datetime="2011-11-05T11:34:23+00:00">Not feeling chatty? If you&#8217;d still like to contribute, I&#8217;d really value your input, so I prepared a simple <a href="#">survey</a> to capture your thoughts more quickly. If you can fill any of this out in however much detail you&#8217;d like, that would be really useful. <a href="#">Go to the survey ></a></del>

## What&#8217;s in it for you

As a token of my appreciation, I&#8217;ll pick the best respondent (based on how interesting and useful your responses are) and buy you something cool from either [Folksy](http://www.folksy.com/) (UK craft marketplace and lovely people) or [Oomlout](http://www.oomlout.co.uk/) (Leeds&#8217; — and indeed the world&#8217;s — friendliest Arduino/electronics store). You choose. Anything you like up to £25, including shipping to you.
