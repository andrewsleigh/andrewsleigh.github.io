Six months after making my pinhole camera, I finally have some results to show for it. And pretty amazing they are! Huge thanks to Justin Beck for his scanning expertise. I&#8217;ve written up my notes in the [projects](/making/pinhole-solar-photography) section, and — as always — there&#8217;s a [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewsleigh/sets/72157628125433667/with/6393988079/). Please check them out and try it yourself.<!--more-->
