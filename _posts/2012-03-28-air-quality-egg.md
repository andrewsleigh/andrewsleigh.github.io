  * Citizens collect data about their hyper-local (not regional) air quality, using a device built on open hardware platforms (Arduino and Nanode)
  * Share that data with the community via [Pachube](https://pachube.com/feeds/48307)
  * Make the data available via open APIs so we can make better decisions about air quality.

It demonstrates the power of low cost, portable, computing and sensors. It shows how open platforms spur innovation. And it provides a great use case for proving the benefits of open data.
