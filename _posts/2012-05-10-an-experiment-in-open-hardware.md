I&#8217;m running a small experiment. Inspired by some interesting uses of open hardware I&#8217;ve seen recently, I decided to design a product, document the process and parameters of the product, and share it as widely as possible to encourage adaption and improvement by others.<!--more-->

## Open hardware

Open hardware is a design philosophy built on the principles of the open-source software movement. By making designs easy to share and adapt,

  * People can more easily access the technology (It&#8217;s not sold at a premium by a company exploiting closed intellectual property)
  * They can adapt it to their own needs (designs are freely available and well-documented so others can make their own changes)
  * Conditions are set for a virtuous circle of innovation through rapid iteration and a kind of technological natural selection (adapt the design, share it back with the community, good designs flourish &#8230; and repeat)

[RepRap](http://reprap.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware), the open source 3D printer, is a famous example of a hardware design that has flourished through openness. (Partly also because it shares another trait with evolutionary biological organisms &#8211; it can replicate itself.)

> To a large extent, the RepRap project is successful because it is open. Openness can be seen as an enabler of collaboration among the growing group of volunteers. – [RepRap Wiki](http://reprap.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware)

Open hardware can also support commercial business models, just as the open-source software movement has. Adafruit, who design and distribute electronics kits, release their designs under an open licence but are unashamedly a commercial operation. They&#8217;ve even recruited Thomas Jefferson as a supporter for the cause:

> He who receives an idea from me receives it without lessening me, as he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me. – [Adafruit website](http://adafruit.com/)

I also [blogged recently](/2012/03/14/union-event-user-makers-and-distributed-production) about a few cool open hardware projects I&#8217;ve seen: Protei and Nanode, and of course Arduino, an open platform that has spawned a huge ecosystem of hackers, engineers, kit makers, teachers and learners.

[<img src="/assets/2012/05/snijlabs_booklets_edit-300x196.jpg" alt="" title="snijlabs_booklets_edit"     class="alignright size-medium wp-image-715" />](http://sniject.wikispaces.com/)These are complex products for the most part. But an open approach can be applied to much more simple projects. Stuart Childs and Full Circle Arts have set up a [design competition](http://sniject.wikispaces.com/) to take Snijlab&#8217;s laser-cut plywood hinge, share the design and encourage others to adapt it. It&#8217;s an experiment in opening up a very specific technique – a single component of a larger designed product – to see how it can be evolved:

> I want to see what happens when we share a particular design or technique amongst a group of people from different backgrounds, with different interests and occupations. – [Sniject](http://sniject.wikispaces.com/)

## My experiment

My experiment is even simpler. I want to make a stand for my laptop. I want to design it to the best of my abilities, but also to be easily adapted by others. I want to document it, and I want to share that design and documentation with others so they can use and improve it.

[<img class="alignnone border" src="/assets/flickr/7163599536_8915c66970.jpg" alt="Version 3 acrylic stand"     />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewsleigh/7163599536/ "Version 3 acrylic stand") 

I generally make useful things that solve a problem for me. The problem here is both simple and chronic: I use a laptop all day for work. The screen needs to be raised off the desk to be at a comfortable height.

It&#8217;s also faced by lots of other people (as evidenced by the number of laptop stands on the market). I&#8217;m interested to see if a problem like this responds well to open-source innovation. On the face of it, it seems like it a quite promising qualities:

  * Easy to define, simple, discrete
  * Chronic, serious, a problem worth solving
  * Faced by many people, others have an incentive to solve it too

I want to find out:

  * Does this sort of product respond well to innovation through openness
  * How should open designs be shared, publicised
  * What are the best ways to encourage re-use by others
  * What kinds of documentation are important

## Take part

I&#8217;ve posted the [digital files up on Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:22724), a repository of &#8220;digital designs for real, physical objects&#8221;. You&#8217;re free to download the files, make your own copy or create a derivative under a [Creative Commons Attribution Share-alike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). You can even sell it if you want.

If you&#8217;re interested in adapting it to suit your needs, you may want to read the [project documentation I&#8217;ve posted up here](/making/open-laptop-stand).

And if you do make a version yourself, or this plants a seed for a different project, I&#8217;d love to hear about it.
