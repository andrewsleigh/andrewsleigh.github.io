In the week that Yahoo poached Marissa Mayer from Google (She who was widely credited with designing the original search page that obsoleted Google&#8217;s competitors), it&#8217;s interesting to consider how much has changed in search, and how Google has lost its grip:

> Search
> 
> Semantic/contextual/intelligent web searching will kill Google if Google doesn’t disrupt itself. Eventually. Google search is a terrible experience for normal people. They don’t know which links they can trust. Some service in the future is going to curate the top 100,000 or 1,000,000 queries into a list of great, precise results. Siri would be a great interface into that kind of system. “Siri, what camera should I buy?” would probably give better results than this. (How that curation or improvement in quality will happen is anyone’s guess.)
