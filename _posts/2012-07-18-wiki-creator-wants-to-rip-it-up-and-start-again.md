> But there is one thing about the wiki that he regrets. "I always felt bad that I owned all those pages," he says. The central idea of a wiki &#8211;whether it&#8217;s driving Wikipedia or C2 &#8212; is that anyone can add or edit a page, but those pages all live on servers that someone else owns and controls. Cunningham now believes that no one should have that sort of central control, so he has built something called the federated wiki.

There are issues that no one will agree on, but with the federated wiki model, everyone can have their own version of controversial pages. &#8220;And they&#8217;re all linked together, so you can still explore them like a wiki.&#8221;
