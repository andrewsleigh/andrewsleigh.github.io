A while back, I [posted](/2012/06/21/creative-work) about how I was looking to try other means of exploring, developing and communicating ideas beyond the computer screen. 

I have also been spending a lot more time in the [company of designers](http://www.clearleft.com) lately, and I&#8217;ve seen sketching used much more frequently and openly as a problem-solving tool. This has spurred me on in my efforts to become a better sketcher.<!--more-->

I have re-discovered the joys of stationery shops, and have developed something of a pen addiction. Much like [fussy coffee](http://5by5.tv/talkshow/87), pens are a geek magnet, and I have been sucked in bigtime.

And if there&#8217;s one thing a pen-geek likes more than buying a new pen, it&#8217;s organising his pens.

Indulging my obsession over on the [Pen Addict blog](http://penaddict.com), I stumbled on a [review of a pen case](http://penaddict.com/blog/2012/11/27/alter-manufacturing-mod02-pencil-case-review) that looked simple enough that I could make one myself.

So I did. Here it is.

It struck me that this would make a really good starter project for someone new to sewing, so I documented the process, pulled together some instructions and observations, and wrote it up as a project.
