I&#8217;m hoping to publish a newspaper. So I ordered some samples from [Newspaper Club](http://www.newspaperclub.com), which arrived yesterday. One of the samples they send out is a test paper. It shows how different type sizes, image styles and ink densities will reproduce on newsprint. This is really useful stuff, and a great piece of marketing that I thought worth sharing. <!--more-->

Even if you have some experience in dead tree publishing, printing a newspaper is likely to be a novel experience, full of special considerations, opportunities and pitfalls. The sample paper works to put you at ease. It makes a complex product easy to buy.

I especially like the back page, showing you what typical quantities of newspapers will look like when they&#8217;re delivered. It&#8217;s useful to know that if you order 5,000 papers, they&#8217;re going to arrive on a palette, and you&#8217;ll need somewhere to put it. 

It shows a deep understanding of the customer &#8216;under consideration&#8217; mindset. All marketing should be as useful as this.
