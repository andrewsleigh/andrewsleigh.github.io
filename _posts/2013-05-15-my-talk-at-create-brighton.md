Last night I spoke at [Create Brighton](http://www.meetup.com/CREATEBrighton/events/111802972/), an event about social innovation and workplace culture (but no relation to Create, Brighton Mini Maker Faire sponsors). I talked about maker culture, and some of the things that makers do that we can apply more broadly in our lives, particularly in enterprise and in business culture.

You can see the slides on [Slideshare here](http://www.slideshare.net/andrewsleigh/create-talk-v4).

Some links to things I mentioned in the talk:

  * DIY [meths burner](http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/gear-features/make-your-own-meths-burner/6227.html) and [pot stand/wind shield](http://www.outdoorsmagic.com/forum/gear/the-caldera-clone/22357.html)

  * [Glengarry Glen Ross](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104348/) (a stressful workplace). I was surprised by how few people had seen this film. It is stunning. In my top 5. Go watch it now.

After the talk, someone asked a question about where to find materials, and I mentioned skip diving, but completely forgot about [Freecycle](http://www.freecycle.org), which [Lisa James kindly reminded me about today](https://twitter.com/petit_monstre/status/334378206234808320). Definitely worth checking out, though you have to be quick to get the good stuff.

Thanks to [David](https://twitter.com/exploringsenses) for recommending me, [Toby](https://twitter.com/tobyonsushi) for the invite, [Tom](http://tomnixon.co.uk) and [Mark](http://www.thembigoaktrees.com) for their great talks, and everyone who came for braving the rain.
