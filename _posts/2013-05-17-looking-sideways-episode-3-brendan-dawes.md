For Episode 3, I interviewed the designer and maker Brendan Dawes. Brendan&#8217;s known for early interactive web projects like Psycho Studio, that allows users to remix Hitchcock&#8217;s famous shower scene themselves. He&#8217;s also known for his physical projects, such as the Moviepeg and Popa phone accessories, and devices that cross the digital/physical divide, such as the Happiness machine, an internet-connected printer that prints random happy thoughts from people across the web.

We talk about making digital stuff tangible, design, art and simplicity, remixes and supercuts, and how makers can get their work out into the world for people to see.<!--more-->

I&#8217;ve written up some of the podcast [on the blog](/2013/05/17/brendan-dawes-sharing-your-work/). You can hear the full interview here.
