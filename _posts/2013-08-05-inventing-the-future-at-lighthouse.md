I&#8217;m very excited to be starting a new job this week at [Lighthouse](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk), the international digital arts agency based &#8211; fortunately for me &#8211; in Brighton.

I&#8217;ll be working as a creative producer, across the programme, but particularly on a new interdisciplinary studio we&#8217;ll be launching in 2014. We&#8217;ll be working from Alan Kay&#8217;s maxim, &#8220;The best way to predict the future is to invent it.&#8221;

I can&#8217;t say much more than that now, because it&#8217;s still early days. However, I will be reaching out to a lot of people over the next few months, so if you&#8217;re working on something interesting in the arts/tech/design worlds, get in touch, and we&#8217;ll have a coffee. You can reach me on Twitter, but also now on andrew {at} lighthouse dot org dot uk.
