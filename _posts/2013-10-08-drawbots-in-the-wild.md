Great to see some people sharing projects they&#8217;ve made from [Hot Glue zine](/projects/hot-glue-zine). I love these videos of Drawbots in action.<!--more-->

Simon Smith shared one his family made in the kitchen:



And the [Buxted Scout group had a whole maker session](http://buxtedscouts.org/2013/09/25/brighton-maker-fair-buxted-style/) with Bare Conductive torches, and what looks like at least 10 Drawbots battling it out together. Badges well earned.
