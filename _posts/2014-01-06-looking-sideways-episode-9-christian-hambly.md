<img class="alignright  wp-image-1703" title="christian" src="/assets/2014/01/christian.jpg" alt=""     />In this episode, I talk to Christian Hambly, and we explore that territory seemingly always on the geek horizon: Coffee.

From espresso machines to domestic brew methods, denaturation to decaffeination, John Gruber to George Clooney, we map out pretty much the whole domain in 55 minutes. If you’re a long-standing coffee nut (‘bean’?), my ill-informed questions will infuriate you, but if, like me, you’re just setting out on this voyage, Christian’s expertise and enthusiasm will guide you to the promised land.<!--more-->

And rest assured, you won’t have to endure any of these metaphors during the show.

Since we recorded this show, I’ve bought a coffee grander, a

So hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to record a follow up episode and go a little deeper.
