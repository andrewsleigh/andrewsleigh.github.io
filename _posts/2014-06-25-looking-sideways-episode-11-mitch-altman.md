<img src="/assets/2014/06/682px-Mitch_Altman_Chaos_Communication_Camp_2011-199x300.jpg" alt="Mitch Altman (Photo by Alexander Klink)" title="Mitch Altman (Photo by Alexander Klink)" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1716" />In a special episode of Looking Sideways, I talk with inventor, hackspace evangelist and all-round legend, Mitch Altman, about how he became a maker, the origins of the legendary Noisebridge hackerspace in San Francisco, the enduring appeal of the soldering iron, how to start your own hackerspace. And of course, the importance of doing what you love.<!--more-->

If you get the opportunity to hear Mitch talk, or take part in one of his soldering is easy workshops (or anyone else’s &#8216;soldering is easy&#8217; workshop, for that matter) I’d thoroughly recommend it.
