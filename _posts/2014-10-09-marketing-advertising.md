I love this line (emphasis mine) about marketing too often ending after purchase. It encapsulates something that I&#8217;ve always found frustrating about how many people try to connect people with products (or brands, or creative endeavours). So often, it&#8217;s just shouting at those people about your product.

> The other powerful question a marketer can ask is: where in the journey are we spending most of our resources? The answer for incumbent brands in markets is usually that most is being spent at the awareness / consideration phase. Sometimes no money at all is spent at or past the point of purchase &#8211; the marketerâ€™s job is done. **A brand is a promise kept, the saying goes, but somehow marketing has drifted into just making promises.**
