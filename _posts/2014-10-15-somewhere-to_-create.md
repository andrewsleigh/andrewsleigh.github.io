I&#8217;ll be on a panel tonight with a bunch of smart people working in the creative/culture world, talking about the paths we took to get to where we are today. My path has been meandering, and rarely well-mapped in advance. I hope that will be some consolation to the young people in the audience, who I&#8217;m guessing will mostly be seeing a great uncertain fog ahead. I&#8217;ll be interested if my guess is wrong, and they all have it planned out.
