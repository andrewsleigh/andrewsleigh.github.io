On Wednesday, I spoke at the [Brighton Strategy and Planning Meetup](http://brilliantnoise.com/brighton-strategy-planning-meetup-2-wednesday-19th-november/), alongside Matthew Bagwell from AKQA, and Krystle Lampshire from Comic Relief.<!--more-->

The theme for the night was _Attention_. I&#8217;ve been looking at the way attention works within the culture industries, and shared some approaches that I&#8217;ve found promising, borrowed from wherever I could find them. It was something of an open-ended presentation, with more questions raised than answers offered, but it was a useful exercise in marshalling my thoughts, and fun to get up and speak to this crowd.

Slides linked below, together with the key sources I made reference to:

  * [John Berger, Ways of Seeing, Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhOVdoMxYxU)
  * [Clayton Christensen, &#8220;job to be done‚Äù](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6496.html)
  * [Amazon and Hachette, dealing with abundance](http://stratechery.com/2014/economic-power-age-abundance/)
  * [Art Happens, crowdfunding platform set up by National Art Collections Fund](http://www.artfund.org/get-involved/art-happens)
