Together with colleague [Hannah Stewart](https://twitter.com/Freerange_Inc), I&#8217;ve just started working on a new research project for Nesta. Our objective is to map the current state of makerspaces in the UK, to provide a resource for people running a makerspace (or thinking about starting one), for researchers, policy makers and users. <!--more-->

It&#8217;s great to be back researching this area; a couple of years ago I did some not dissimilar [research for O&#8217;Reilly](http://localhost:8888/wordpress/help-me-research-the-uk-maker-community/ "Help me research the UK Maker community"), but while in that case, the output was business-focused and not something we could share freely, in this case, we&#8217;ll be producing an open data set that anyone can use.

We&#8217;re also planning on doing our work &#8216;in the open&#8217;, as much as possible, to work with the maker community and others to get the most useful data we can.

We&#8217;ll be carrying out our research over the winter, and reaching out to all of the publicly accessible makerspaces in the UK. If you&#8217;re interested in taking part, or want to know more about the project, check out the [research blog on the Nesta website](http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/open-dataset-uk-makerspaces), or say to [me](https://twitter.com/andrewsleigh) or [Hannah](https://twitter.com/Freerange_Inc) on Twitter.
