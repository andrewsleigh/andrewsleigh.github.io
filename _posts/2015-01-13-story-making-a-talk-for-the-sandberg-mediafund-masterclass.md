On Saturday, I gave a presentation to participants in the [Sandberg Instituut&#8217;s](www.sandberg.nl) &#8220;Unmapping Europe&#8221; masterclass. As part of this, 16 documentary makers, artists, programmers, researchers and designers work in small teams on innovative projects, and to kick things off, came to Brighton for a ‘sensing weekend’. <!--more-->

I was privileged to speak alongside [Basia Lewandowska Cummings](https://mishearances.wordpress.com), and also to give some guidance to the project teams as they explored their initial ideas.

This talk was something of a diversion for me, and a welcome one at that, as I considered some ways in which we can think about the objects we make – and the products we manufacture – as being vessels for stories. I touched on branding (as always!), the maker movement and the problem of nostalgia, supply chains and mediated products.
