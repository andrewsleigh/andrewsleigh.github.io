I&#8217;m pleased to say the [research project](/projects/nesta-makerspace-research) I&#8217;ve been working on with Nesta is now complete. Together with Hannah Stewart, I&#8217;ve been collecting data to build a picture off the state of makerspaces in the UK, and we have published a structured data set under an open Creative Commons licence [here](http://www.nesta.org.uk/publications/open-dataset-uk-makerspaces-users-guide), together with a handy user guide that pulls out the key findings.

It&#8217;s been my first project for Nesta, and a very rewarding one at that. I know several people have expressed interest in building on our data, so I hope it will be a useful building block for future projects, as well as being of interest to researchers, makerspaces and makers.

Thanks to Hannah for being such a good collaborator, to Kate at Nesta for being such a lovely person to work with, and to all the makerspace founders and managers who went out of their way to help us out.
