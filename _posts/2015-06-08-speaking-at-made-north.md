I&#8217;ll be speaking, and on a panel talking about the New Maker Economy, at the Made North Conference on 18 June, which is part of Sheffield Design week.<!--more-->

As [the blurb](http://www.sheffielddesignweek.co.uk/speakers/the-new-maker-economy/) says: 

> Makerspaces, fablabs, and community workshops are experiencing huge growth across the country, increasing from just a handful ten years ago to nearly a hundred across the country today. What opportunity do they hold for designers and how can technology create opportunities?
