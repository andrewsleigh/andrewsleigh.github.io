I spoke today at an event organised by Loughborough University Arts, as part of their Market Town programme. I promised I&#8217;d post my slides, and some useful links, and so here they are.

## Makerspaces on the High Street

There is a great deal of interest in the rise of makerspaces and other sites of autonomous creative production. Can this energy be harnessed to power civic regeneration, and help create more liveable urban spaces? This talk draws on some research I co-authored for Nesta to set out an overview of where makerspaces came from, where they are now, and how they might contribute to the development of urban spaces.
