I&#8217;m helping put together a conference later this month at the V&A called [Maker Assembly](http://makerassembly.org). It&#8217;s an attempt to catalyse a more critical reflective discussion about maker culture, and add some more depth to our understanding of what making is about, and how we can do it better.

As part of that effort, I interviewed one of our speakers, Dean Brown about a project of his, the 7 Lamps of Making, in which he revisits the work of John Ruskin, the 19th Century art critic, who was a key influence on the Arts and Crafts movement, itself a resonant movement today.

You can [read that article over on the Lighthouse website](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/dean-brown-the-7-lamps-of-making). As a little experiment in publishing and exposure, I also [posted a version on Medium](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/dean-brown-the-7-lamps-of-making), to see if it got any traction or more visibility there.
