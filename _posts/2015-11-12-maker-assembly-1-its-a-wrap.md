Our first Maker Assembly event at the V&A was a great success, by all accounts. We had some nice feedback from participants and speakers; and as a test, it was useful: it felt to me like there is demand for this kind of critical conversation about making, and this is not served well at the moment. <!--more-->

There is huge scope here for interesting ideas, people, conversations and activities; I feel like we&#8217;ve uncovered only a fraction of the issues that could be covered. In particular, there are so many diverse cultures of making outside of the well-known categories (such as US/Europe-centric traditions, studio crafts, modern &#8216;maker movement&#8217; ideas, the Arts and Crafts movement, hackspaces, etc.). Im looking forward to seeing where we can take this next.

I hope there will be more events, and possibly also [editorial](https://medium.com/maker-assembly/john-ruskin-grandfather-of-the-maker-movement-853706eb2bd) or even exhibition formats. 

I&#8217;ve collected some material about the vent on my [Maker Assembly project page](/projects/maker-assembly). Or check the [main website](http://makerassembly.org) for current news.
