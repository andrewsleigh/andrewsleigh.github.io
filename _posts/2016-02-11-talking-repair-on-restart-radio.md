This week, I was invited to be a guest on the Restart Project&#8217;s radio show on Resonance FM. we talked about the intersection of making and repair cultures, making a spot welder out of a microwave, and a bit of juicy news, &#8220;Error 53&#8221; (which will be long-forgotten in no time at all&#8230;).
