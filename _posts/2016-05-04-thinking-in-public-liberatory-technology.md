I’m trying to articulate an argument about the liberatory potential — or otherwise — of technology, and in particular the technology of makers: to help humans become freer, more creative, less beholden to systems of constraint, and so on.

It’s proving difficult, so instead of trying to finish the whole in a one-er, I’m going to lay out pieces of the jigsaw as they come to mind (or to some level of clarity) and see if I can piece together something that makes sense.

I’ll do this in public (note the optimism of a new project) rather than a series of Evernote entries or Post-its on the wall, to enforce some kind of clarity in my thinking and writing. Some form of organisation will emerge, tbc.
