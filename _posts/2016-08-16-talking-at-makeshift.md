I&#8217;ll be taking part in this year&#8217;s Crafts Council biennial _[Make:Shift Innovation Conference](http://www.craftscouncil.org.uk/what-we-do/makeshift/)._ I went to the 2014 event at Ravensbourne in London, which was one of the best conferences I&#8217;d ever been to, with inspiring talks, a lively atmosphere, and the sense that you could say hello to anyone there, and be sure to have just met someone interesting.

Needless to say, I&#8217;m very pleased to be invited to take part this time round in Manchester. I&#8217;ll be chairing a panel on body augmentation and prosthetic devices, which ties in rather nicely with another project I&#8217;m developing at the moment, details of which will be announced shortly!
