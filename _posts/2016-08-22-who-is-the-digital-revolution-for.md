The University of Sussex&#8217;s SPRU (Science Policy Research Unit) are running this event as part of Brighton Digital Festival: [Who is the Digital Revolution For?](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/who-is-the-digital-revolution-for-2/):

> How can we re-discover our sense of enchantment with digital technology?
  
> For many of us, digital technologies have been revolutionary. Yet at the same time, some feel disenchanted with the consequences.
> 
> The digital is cast increasingly as an instrument of surveillance, or a tool for disciplining ‘gig economies’, and a material burden upon our environment and climate.

I&#8217;ll be chairing the panel, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to this opportunity to talk in public with some of the people who have given me most food for thought over the year about critical approaches to technology, innovation and making.
