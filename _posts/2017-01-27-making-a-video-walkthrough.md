I made wallet, and also made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxPW30B7g60) of the process, as an excuse to learn some video production and editing skills.



I managed to get it down to about 6 minutes. I&#8217;m about 50% happy with it. The first version was 20 minutes, and boring as hell. This is better, but still needs to be snappier. However, progress nonetheless. [I wrote up the project as well.](/making/lightweight-tyvek-wallet)
