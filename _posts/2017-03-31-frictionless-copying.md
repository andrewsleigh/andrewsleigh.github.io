Two weak signals in one day means something worth noting on the blog:

Firstly, this in the [Maker Pro newsletter](http://makezine.com/tag/maker-pro/):

> &#8220;And if you can&#8217;t win by coloring inside the lines, check out [this profile](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/30/a-24-year-old-made-345000-by-beating-kickstarters-to-market.html?utm_source=MakerPro+20170330&utm_medium=email&utm_term=&utm_content=text&utm_campaign=newsletter) of a pseudonymous hustler who identifies up-and-coming crowdfunding campaigns â€” and then does whatever it takes to beat them to market. We&#8217;ve discussed this moral gray area before, but he reportedly netted some $345,000 in just three months.&#8221;

And this on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13924546&utm_term=comment):

> [Sellers printing counterfeit books and selling under Amazon&#8217;s brand](https://twitter.com/billpollock/status/844030960333152256?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=fav)

Both illustrate the risks of depending on someone else&#8217;s platform for your business. But more than that they illustrate the dynamics of friction in a system are highly disruptive. Reduce the friction in a process to near zero and suddenly whole kinds of business become unsustainable.
