Big changes afoot in 2018 – I&#8217;m going back to school.

I&#8217;m taking part in this year&#8217;s [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org) programme at the [new Fablab at the University of Brighton](http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/fablab/). Fab Academy is a 5 month course that teaches students &#8216;how to make (almost) anything&#8217; using the tools in a fablab.<!--more-->

It&#8217;s [very intensive](http://fab.academany.org/2018/schedule.html), with each lesson lasting one week, before moving onto the next topic. That means we have one week to learn [how to design a circuitboard](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html); one week to learn [3D modelling](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_design/index.html); one week to learn [how to use a Shopbot](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/computer_machining/index.html), etc.

I&#8217;m pretty excited to be spending a lot more time in a workshop, and also to be back in full-on learning mode. I think it will be good for my brain, if not my stress levels, and I hope it will open up some new territory for me professionally, and as a maker.

If you want to find out more, you can follow my progress on [my project site on the Fab Academy archive](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabbrighton/students/andrew-sleigh/). And I&#8217;m also using this as an excuse to start another podcast. For a while, I&#8217;ve been wanting to try a short, spontaneous weekly show: low overhead, lightly edited, with more of a live feel. So I&#8217;m planning to record a short show each week, tracking the course, but mostly talking about the softer side of Fab Academy – what it feels like, and what I think it might all mean. I hope that will be slightly more interesting than waffling on about laser kerfs and version control&#8230;

It&#8217;s called [Unreliable Devices](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabbrighton/students/andrew-sleigh/category/podcast.html). If you&#8217;re interested, you can [subscribe in Apple podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/unreliable-devices/id1340450476), or just [grab the RSS feed](http://fab.academany.org/2018/labs/fablabbrighton/students/andrew-sleigh/podcast.rss).
