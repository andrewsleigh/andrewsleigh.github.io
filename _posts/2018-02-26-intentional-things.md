I was recently asked to write 3 pieces for Kickstarter about building values into maker-led businesses â€“ for the kinds of people launching hardware products on their platform. These pieces follow on from a [series](https://machinesroom.co.uk/kickstarter-talks/) of talks Kickstarter and Machines Room hosted in late 2017.

The first, on [Ethical Electronics](https://medium.com/kickstarter/ethical-electronics-47be26d7d178?sf84492359=1), has just been published on the [Kickstarter blog](https://medium.com/@kickstarter). I&#8217;ll link up the others here when they&#8217;re published.
