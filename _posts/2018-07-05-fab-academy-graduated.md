Well, that was a blast.

In mid-January, I quit my job, and started a new adventure at the University of Brighton fab lab: [Fab Academy](/projects/fab-academy/).

I knew it would be interesting, challenging, and hard work; little did I know how much. Over the course of 5 months, I came to love walking down the corridors of Heavy Engineering; every week coming into the lab to learn and make something new.<!--more-->

Those 5 months passed in a blur, but I&#8217;m happy to say I passed, and will be graduating in Toulouse at Fab 14.

I don&#8217;t know what comes next, but I hope to spend a lot more time in a fab lab somewhere &#8230;
