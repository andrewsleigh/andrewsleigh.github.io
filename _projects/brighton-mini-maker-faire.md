Brighton Mini Maker Faire was a festival of DIY technology, hacking, invention, creativity, craft, tinkering and innovation. Running since 2011, we were the first independent Maker Faire in the UK, and have had over 10,000 visitors to the 4 Faires we ran.

Brighton Mini Maker Faire took place every September, as part of Brighton Digital Festival. We played around with other formats and ways of making, including [fanzines](/projects/hot-glue-zine "Hot Glue Zine") and [exhibitions](/projects/makers-at-work "Makers at Work").
