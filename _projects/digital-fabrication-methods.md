I'm teaching a course in digital fabrication – and learning by making – at the University of Brighton.

<!--more-->

Digital Fabrication Methods is an optional module for undergraduates in the schools of Media, Art and Design and Architecture. On one level, it's a course that aims to give students a grounding in a diverse range of processes in digital fabrication: from 3D printing to moulding and casting; electronics to programming.

On another level, it's an attempt to equip students with the skills needed to approach highly complex subjects that would conventionally be taught through a theoretical approach, but in this case are tackled 'hands-first'. We teach learning by doing, and the construction of knowledge by students making their own technology. 

The course is heavily based on the content that I studied as a [Fab Academy](../fab-academy/) student in 2018. 

The course material is all publicly available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fablabbrighton/digital-fabrication-module) and published through [GitHub Pages](https://fablabbrighton.github.io/digital-fabrication-module/course-notes/).
