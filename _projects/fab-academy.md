From January to June 2018, I took part in [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org), the globally-distributed learning programme of the Fablab network.  

<span class="label">2018</span>

I was based at the [new Fablab at the University of Brighton](http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/fablab/), and one of 220 students from 45 countries, in 65 Fablabs around the world, learning &#8216;how to make (almost) anything&#8217;.

Over 5 months, I learned about all aspects of digital fabrication: machines, materials and processes; design, coding and fabrication; documentation and workflow. It was hands-on, but also intellectually taxing. One minute, we were mixing resin, the next poring over a microcontroller data sheet.

As well as learning the syllabus of the course, I also learned _how to learn_; how to get stuff done under immense time pressure; how to solve intractable problems; how to share with and learn from my colleagues; how to prototype; and how to document my work, and make it replicable.

Fab Academy is structured around 20 weekly lectures and assignments, each focusing on a different aspect of making. There&#8217;s a strong focus on electronics and software, with about half the course covering electronics design, production and programming. As a relative newcomer, this was a steep learning curve for me, but with help from some experts, I was able to get to grips with programming in a way that Iâ€™ve never been able to before.

I tried to make a list of all the things I learned, to give a sense of the breadth of the course.

**Machines and tools**

  * Desktop CNC milling machine (for mould-making and circuit board fabrication)
  * Flatbed CNC mill (for wood)
  * Laser cutter
  * 3D printer
  * Vinyl cutter
  * Oscilloscope

**Processes**

  * Laser-cutting press-fit assemblies and chassis in plastic and wood
  * Milling pre-molds from modelling wax
  * Casting with silicon and resins
  * Milling sheet aluminium for folding
  * Milling copper circuit boards
  * SMD soldering (by hand)
  * Electronics design and production
  * Making composite materials

**Software tools**

  * 2D CAD in Illustrator
  * 3D (parametric) CAD in Fusion 360
  * Circuit design in Eagle

**Coding**

  * Arduino for hardware control
  * Processing for visualisation on the desktop
  * Communicating between devices with I2C, SPI and plain vanilla serial
  * Embedded programming with AVR chips (mostly ATMega32u4)

**Documentation and workflow**

  * Jekyll and markdown for static site generation
  * Git for version control and website deployment
  * Video editing
