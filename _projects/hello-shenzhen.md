Hello Shenzhen is bilateral residency exchange programme connecting makers in the UK and China.

At [Lighthouse](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/programme/hello-shenzhen) in March 2017, we hosted a Chinese researcher, Dr Wen Wen, from Shenzhen University. During the residency Wen and I visited maker spaces in Brighton and mapped maker cultures and networks in Brighton and Shenzhen.


I wrote about that experience on the [Lighthouse blog](http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/blog/17/04/03/finding-common-ground/), and the British Council produced a [video about the exchange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ6iEj8YUb0) here:



In November 2017, I travelled with Lighthouse to Shenzhen for a return visit, to explore the Chinese experience of making and, in particular, the differences between the UK’s grassroots maker movement and China’s emerging entrepreneurial maker scene.

I interviewed makers, designers and entrepreneurs for a series of podcasts that have been released on the [Looking Sideways](https://lookingsideways.net/category/hello-shenzhen/) feed in early-2018. I also wrote up some thoughts about that experience [here](https://medium.com/lighthousearts/maker-culture-in-shenzhen-bottom-up-meets-top-down-66c66027ed1b).
