Looking Sideways is a podcast about making – how we make things, and how those things make us. I talk to smart people about technology, craft, innovation, and design.

[Looking Sideways](https://lookingsideways.net) is my podcast and radio show about making, design, and material culture. There have been two regular series. The [first](https://lookingsideways.net/category/s01/) (in 2015) was very much acting on a hunch, and covered all sots of topics I found interesting. Pretty much an excuse to talk to interesting people.

The [second](https://lookingsideways.net/category/s02/) (in 2016) was simultaneously broadcast on Resonance FM, and was very maker-focused. Having spent a lot of time working with makers – inside the culture – some questions keep popping up: What’s the value of making by hand when we can buy everything we need courtesy of a global manufacturing system that we can access with a swipe across glass? Are craft practices inherently nostalgic or can they point us towards valid ways of making in the future? How are new ways of making – open-source design; making on or in the body; digital fabrication – changing the relationships between makers and consumers; between makers, and the things we make?

Looking Sideways has also spun off a [special mini-series about making in Shenzhen](https://lookingsideways.net/category/hello-shenzhen/), as part of the [Hello Shenzhen](/projects/hello-shenzhen/) exchange programme.

I also work as a freelance producer. You&#8217;ll be able to hear the first fruits of this work, a series covering craft innovation, in 2018.
