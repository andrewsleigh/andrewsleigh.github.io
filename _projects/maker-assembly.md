A collaborative project to build a critical community around making. We bring people together to learn about diverse making cultures, support new grassroots activity, and cast a critical eye over the conventional stories of making: its past and future, its politics and impact.

[Maker Assembly](http://makerassembly.org) is a gathering of makers, and a critical conversation about maker culture: its past, present and future. Through events, networks, editorial and more, we aim to catalyse a more informed reflective debate about making today: what it means to be a maker, the role of making in a contemporary industrial/consumer society, the responsibility of makers to the environment, and the diverse kinds of making that can happen when you look to different classes of maker, communities and cultures.

It&#8217;s co-ordinated by by a network of collaborators, with core funding support from the Comino Foundation. We&#8217;ve also been supported by the British Council, the V&A, and Lighthouse.

From 2015â€“17 our main activity was organising a series of events around the UK, in London, Sheffield, Manchester, Edinburgh (and with local partners, in Belfast).

In 2018, we&#8217;re looking to distribute the network further, and work with more local partners to support diverse activities across the country.

All the info is on the [Maker Assembly website](http://makerassembly.org). A few other bits I&#8217;ve written  from around the web:

  * I posted [some thoughts on what a gathering of makers might look like](/2015/06/13/makers-come-together/) on this blog, back in 2015
  * I wrote up [my thoughts on the first Maker Assembly on the Lighthouse website](http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/reflections-on-maker-assembly-2015).
  * <span style="font-size: 1rem;">I </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="https://medium.com/maker-assembly/john-ruskin-grandfather-of-the-maker-movement-853706eb2bd">interviewed one of our speakers, Dean Brown</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;">, about the roots of the Maker Movement in the writings of John Ruskin. </span>
  * And another, Annabella Pollen, [about the role of making in the postwar utopian  youth organisation, Kindred of the Kibbo Kift](https://medium.com/maker-assembly/kindred-of-the-kibbo-kift-7943a4c095fc).
