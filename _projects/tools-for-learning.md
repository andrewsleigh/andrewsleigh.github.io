An ongoing project to build a set of machines, workshop tools, devices and products that help people learn through making.

<span class="label">2018-Present</span>

<!--more-->

So far, they include simple electronics boards to help students learn to solder, a fab-able Arduino clone to enable people to make interactive projects with fully self-made parts, and a camera slider to introduce motion control, machine design and embedded programming. As well as the artefacts themselves, the project focuses on documenting the process of learning, design and iteration, and sharing of code, source files, and development history. The projects are a way for me to learn about new processes and technologies, and to formalise methods for learning and design through making.

Current tools:
