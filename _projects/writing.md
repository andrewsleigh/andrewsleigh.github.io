I write and speak about technology, business, art, and making. I&#8217;m interested in new digital fabrication tools, maker startups and the creative use of technology. I&#8217;m also interested in critical approaches to technology, craft and manufacturing.

[This blog](https://andrewsleigh.com/blog "Blog") is a scratchpad for current thinking; it&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find hunches, notes and my attempts to work in public. Sometimes I post archive copies of commissioned work or other longer pieces here too.

As part of the [Maker Assembly project](/projects/maker-assembly), I&#8217;m also doing some long-form critical writing and interviews, which you can find up on our [Medium publication](https://medium.com/maker-assembly/). And I&#8217;ve written some things for Lighthouse, for example about Hello Shenzhen &#8211; the [UK visit](https://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/blog/17/04/03/finding-common-ground/) and [China return trip](https://medium.com/lighthousearts/maker-culture-in-shenzhen-bottom-up-meets-top-down-66c66027ed1b).

I try to keep a note of forthcoming and past talks here on the [blog](/blog).

You should also  listen to my podcast, [Looking Sideways](https://lookingsideways.net), which is my excuse to speak with incredibly smart people from the worlds of design, making, technology and more.
